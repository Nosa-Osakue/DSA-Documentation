This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with Incubator Hub. 

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building

## Project Topic: E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overwiew

This Data Analysis project aims to generate insignt into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.
